        Due to its nature, this application is often flagged as a virus by Chrome, Microsoft Defender or other antivirus software. **This is an expected false-positive and not a bug** - the application is open-source, and thus anyone can verify it contains no malware.

        If you absolutely do not trust this application, you are welcome to simply not use it. Otherwise, I recommend instructing your antivirus to ignore this detection, usually done by whitelisting the application in the antivirus' settings. Due to the sheer number of antivirus engines out there, I am unable to provide specific instructions on how to do so, so you will have to figure it out on your own. Alternatively, running the application from source should also prevent triggering a detection.

        You're welcome to read through the discussion under these issues, for more information regarding this false-positive: #741, #503, #137, #13.
