To keep the status (ONLINE or OFFLINE) of the channels up-to-date, there's a websocket connection estabilished that receives events about streams going up or down, or updates regarding the current amount of viewers.",

If you want to mine specific games first, use the \"Priority\" list to setup an ordered list of games of your choice. Games from the top of the list will be attempted to be mined first, before the ones lower down the list.\n5. Keep the \"Priority only\" option checked, to avoid mining games that are not on the priority list. Or not - it's up to you.\n6.
