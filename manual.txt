Available command line arguments:

• --tray
	Start the application as minimised into tray.
• -v
	Increase verbosity level. Can be stacked up several times (-vv, -vvv, etc.) to show
	increasingly more information during application runtime.
• --log
	Enables logging of runtime information into a 'log.txt' file. Verbosity level of this logging
	matches the level set by `-v`.
• --dump
	Start the application in a data-dump mode, where a 'dump.dat' file is created.
	The file contains anonymous raw Twitch API data, studying of which can help troubleshoot
	issues with the application. The application automatically closes shortly after launching,
	once dumping is finished.
• --version
	Show application version information.

Note: Additional settings are available within the application GUI.

Exit codes:

• 0: Application exited successfully
• 1: Exit caused by the CAPTCHA or a Fatal Exception
