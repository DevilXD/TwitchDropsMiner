Available command line arguments:

• --tray
	Start the application as minimised into tray.
• -v
	Increase verbosity level. Can be stacked up several times (-vv, -vvv, etc.) to show
	increasingly more information during application runtime.
• --log
	Enables logging of runtime information into a 'log.txt' file. Verbosity level of this logging
	matches the level set by `-v`.
• --stdlog
	Enables logging of runtime information to stdout/stderr. Verbosity level of this logging
	matches the level set by `-v`.
• --dump
	Start the application in a data-dump mode, where a 'dump.dat' file is created.

	issues with the application. The application automatically closes shortly after launching,
	once dumping is finished.
• --version
	Show application version information.

Note: Additional settings are available within the application GUI.
